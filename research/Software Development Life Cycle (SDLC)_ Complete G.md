# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): Complete Guide

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process for developing high-quality software through structured phases, from initial planning to ongoing maintenance. The standard SDLC consists of **seven distinct phases**, each with specific tasks and deliverables that ensure successful software development.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

## Overview of SDLC Phases

The SDLC comprises **7 phases, 77 key tasks, and 81 artifacts** that guide teams through the complete software development journey. Each phase builds upon the previous one, creating a comprehensive framework for delivering robust software solutions.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

## Phase 1: Planning

The planning phase establishes the foundation for the entire project by defining its direction and feasibility.[^2][^3][^4]

**Key Tasks:**

- Define project goals and objectives
- Identify stakeholders and their roles
- Conduct feasibility study (technical, operational, financial)
- Perform risk analysis and mitigation planning
- Define project scope and boundaries
- Create project roadmap with milestones and timelines
- Define roles and responsibilities
- Establish success criteria and KPIs
- Allocate resources and budget[^3][^2]

**Key Artifacts:**

- Project Charter
- Feasibility Study Report
- Project Plan/Roadmap
- Risk Assessment Document
- Resource Allocation Plan
- Business Case
- Stakeholder Analysis Document
- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)[^5][^2]

The planning phase establishes clear project direction, ensuring all participants understand what needs to be accomplished and how to achieve it.[^4]

## Phase 2: Requirements Analysis

This phase focuses on gathering and documenting detailed software requirements from stakeholders.[^1][^2][^6]

**Key Tasks:**

- Gather business requirements from stakeholders
- Conduct requirement elaboration sessions
- Analyze functional and non-functional requirements
- Perform technical specifications analysis
- Perform operational specifications analysis
- Validate requirements feasibility
- Document user stories and use cases
- Create requirements traceability matrix
- Review and approve requirements with stakeholders[^6][^7][^8]

**Key Artifacts:**

- Business Requirements Document (BRD) - contains high-level business requirements[^9][^10][^11]
- Software Requirements Specification (SRS) - detailed functional and non-functional requirements[^12][^10][^9]
- Functional Requirements Document (FRD/FRS) - granular functional requirements with data flow[^10][^9]
- Non-Functional Requirements Document
- Use Cases and User Stories
- Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)
- Process Flow Diagrams
- Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)[^13][^7][^1]

The requirements analysis phase is crucial, as 66% of software projects fail due to inadequate requirement gathering.[^8]

## Phase 3: Design

The design phase transforms requirements into technical blueprints for development.[^13][^3][^4]

**Key Tasks:**

- Create system architecture design
- Design database schema and ER diagrams
- Create UI/UX wireframes and mockups
- Design API specifications and endpoints
- Define module specifications and interactions
- Create high-level design (HLD)
- Create low-level design (LLD)
- Design security implementation
- Define coding standards and conventions
- Design algorithm specifications[^3][^13]

**Key Artifacts:**

- High-Level Design (HLD) Document - system architecture and component diagrams[^13]
- Low-Level Design (LLD) Document - detailed module specifications, algorithms, data structures[^13]
- Design Document Specification (DDS)
- System Architecture Diagram
- Database Design Document (ER Diagrams, Schema)
- UI/UX Wireframes and Mockups
- Prototypes
- API Specifications
- Interface Specifications
- Technical Specifications Document
- Class Diagrams
- Sequence Diagrams
- Data Dictionary
- Network Topology Diagram[^3][^13]

A well-executed design phase reduces development time by 30-40% and significantly decreases post-deployment defects.[^13]

## Phase 4: Development/Implementation

The development phase is where engineers convert design specifications into functional code.[^3][^14]

**Key Tasks:**

- Write and implement code based on design
- Integrate software components and libraries
- Conduct unit testing on individual modules
- Perform code reviews
- Document code for future reference
- Follow coding standards and guidelines
- Implement algorithms and business logic
- Develop database scripts
- Version control management
- Conduct peer code reviews[^14][^3]

**Key Artifacts:**

- Source Code
- Code Documentation
- Unit Test Cases
- Unit Test Results
- Build Scripts
- Database Scripts (DDL/DML)
- Integration Scripts
- Code Review Reports
- Version Control Logs
- API Implementation[^15][^14]

Developers are responsible for writing code, integrating components, conducting unit tests, documenting their work, and participating in code reviews.[^14]

## Phase 5: Testing

The testing phase systematically evaluates software to detect defects and verify quality before deployment.[^16]

**Key Tasks:**

- Create test plan and test strategy
- Design test cases and test scenarios
- Set up test environment
- Execute unit testing
- Perform integration testing
- Conduct system testing
- Execute User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- Perform regression testing
- Conduct performance and load testing
- Execute security testing
- Log and track defects
- Verify bug fixes and retest
- Create test summary report[^3][^16]

**Key Artifacts:**

- Test Plan Document
- Test Strategy Document
- Test Cases and Test Scenarios
- Test Scripts
- Test Data
- Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)
- Test Execution Reports
- Defect/Bug Reports
- Test Summary Report
- UAT Sign-off Document
- Performance Test Results
- Security Test Results

Testing typically consumes 20-30% of the total project timeline and includes multiple testing types: unit, integration, system, UAT, regression, performance, and security testing.[^16]

## Phase 6: Deployment

The deployment phase involves releasing the software to production and making it available to end users.[^4][^17][^18]

**Key Tasks:**

- Develop deployment plan
- Prepare production environment
- Configure servers and infrastructure
- Perform database migration
- Install system in production
- Execute training plan for users
- Communicate deployment to users
- Perform data entry or conversion

- Acceptance Plan and Sign-off[^18][^19][^17]

Deployment can be done on-premise or in the cloud, depending on project needs, and typically includes a beta-testing phase with a limited group of users.[^4]

## Phase 7: Maintenance

The maintenance phase ensures software continues functioning correctly and adapts to changing needs after deployment.[^3][^4][^20]

**Key Tasks:**

- Monitor system performance
- Identify and fix bugs/defects
- Perform root cause analysis
